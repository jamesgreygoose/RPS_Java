# workshop_java_rock_paper_scissors
Using Java I/O from the command line, build a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors program

**We're going to rebuild Rock-Paper-Scissors but running in Java**

### What we'll need to do:
- Take input from the command line
- Select a random choice for the computer's play
- Parse the input from the command line, check it's valid and check it against the computer's play
- Output whether the player: Won, Lost or Drew
